Diff between an ordinary file and a FIFO:

1) FIFOs are nothing more than pipes, except they have a name in the 
   file system.

2) FIFO open will block until another process has opened the same FIFO
   for the complimentary operation. 
   open for reading will block until another process opens for write and
   vice versa. 

3) A read on FIFO will return 0 if no process has the FIFO open 
   for complementary operation. 

4) A write on FIFO with no process open for read, will generate
   SIGPIPE. Default action is termination. 
   If this signal is caught or ignored write will return errno of EPIPE.

5) Data once read from a pipe or FIFO by any process can not be re read. 
   Where as with files no such restrictions.
