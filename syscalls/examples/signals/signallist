isignal1.c 
signal.c  Can demonstrate that signal being handled 
          is blocked in the duration of the handler. 

action.c simulate old style signal() behaviour. 
action1.c  Retrieves info with sa_sigaction being set and SA_SIGINFO
           act var is global so that it is zeroed and sa_handler 
           is automatically null. 


Why blocking? Reentrancy required. 
ex: strtok. 


actionblock.c  Sets the handler and then blocks sig 2. 

actionblock1.c  Sets the handler for signals 2 ans 10. But species
                sig 2 is blocked when signal 10 is handled.



But signals can generally be lost, even if they are reliable.
