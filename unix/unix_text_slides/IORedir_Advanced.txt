I/O redirection
---------------

1) Observe the data saved to the respective files with stdout redirection:
   echo hello > f1-1
   echo world > f1-2
   echo f1-1 > out  f1-2
   cat  f1-1 > out f1-2
  
   What is the difference between the last two commands?
  
   What will be result of the following commands?
   > out
   > f1-4
  
2) echo hello > f2-1
   echo world > f2-2
   echo UNIX  > f2-3
   echo HELLO > f2-1 WORLD > f2-2 UNIX > f2-3

   Explain on the file contents as a result of stdout redirections

3) touch hello unix
   ls -l hello world unix > hello 2>err
   ls -l hello
   cat hello
 
   Explain on the difference of file sizes of hello.

   Change the first ls command to capture both errors and stdout to the file hello.

4) echo hello > f4-1
   echo world >> f4-1  how are you > f4-1

   Will the line with the word "hello" be retained in the file f4-1? Explain?
   Will changing the order of > and >> operators result in any difference?

5) Insert the following two lines to both the files f5-1 and f5-2:

   world
   hello

   what will happen with "cat f5-1 > f5-1"   and "cat f5-2>> f5-2" ?

   What would be the result with sort command instead of cat?

6) Create two files f6-1 and f6-2 with differing contents.
   What will be the result of ?

   sort   < f6-1     f6-2
   sort     f6-1   < f6-2
   sort   < f6-1   > hello  < f6-2  > out
   sort   < f6-1   > hello    f6-2  > out
