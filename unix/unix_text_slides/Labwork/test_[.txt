-ne     Not Equal to
-lt      Lesser Than
-le      Lesser Than or Equal to
-gt     Greater Than
-ge    Greater Than or Equal to


X=30
[ $X -gt 100 ]


String test:

\>  Greater than
\>  Less than
=   Equality
!=  Inequality
-z  Zero Length
-n  Non-Zero Length

Z=pqr
[ $Z \> ab ]

-f	File exists and is a ordinary file.
-d	File exists and is a directory file.	
-s	File exists and has size greater than 0	.
-r	File exists and is readable.

Logical Operators

-o    Logical OR
-a    Logical AND
!     Logical Not

[ $X \> 100    -a    -r file1 ]

Will succeed if X is greater than pqr and
